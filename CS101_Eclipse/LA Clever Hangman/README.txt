Impressions of the assignment:

Very fun assignment. Felt like it brought everything we learned into a single assignment.

Assumptions of my code:

I am assuming the user is competent as there are no provisions for user error.
That is, I'm assuming the user won't guess the same letter twice, will follow instructions,
will guess only letters when guessing the secret word, etc.
